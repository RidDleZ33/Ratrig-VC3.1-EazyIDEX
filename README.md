# Ratrig-VC3.1-EazyIDEX
Modified printed parts for the RatRig V-Core 3.1 printers. Flips the hybrid Y motors to Allow IDEX to be installed without frame modification. I will have two flavors here. .

-STOCK will use modified VC3.1 joiners so the X gantry is 3.1 stock. This way you don't need any new hardware.

-3/4 HYBRID will use the joiners, modified idlers and X gantry from the new VC4 repo. Effecively giving the 3.1 a VC4 hybrid drivetrain. This way you will use all endstops, toolheads, etc from the VC4 IDEX. (note there is clearance issues with the toolhead 'vc4_back' part. I think you can use the vc3_back part from the rr toolhead upgrade repo for the 3.1. I'll update this when I know for sure)

Both options will result in loss of printing volume in the X dimension. The point of this is to easily add IDEX to current VC3.1 units wihout having to modify the frame.

For the aluminum 'plates' I resin print these in eSUN Hard Tough resin. If you can not source them I recommend this.

BOM coming at some point. Only real difference from official Enclosed Vcore 3.1 IDEX BOM is: 

2x M5x75 cap head screws

2x M5x45 cap head screws

2x M6x20 countersink screw
