This plate will adapt an LGx_Lite extruder to the new RR toolhead.
Still need to make modified toolboard_vertical for standoff mount.**

BOM:
1x adapter (I resin printed it, but I'm sure you could FDM print)
1x toolboard_vertical mount for attaching to extruder
4x M3x8 countersink head screws
2x M3x8 cap head screws (stock ones for mounting orbiter)
