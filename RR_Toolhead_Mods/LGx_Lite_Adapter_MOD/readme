This plate will adapt an LGx_Lite extruder to the new RR toolhead.

BOM:
1x adapter (I resin printed it, but I'm sure you could FDM print)
1x toolboard_vertical mount for attaching to extruder
1x M3x30 cap head screw for enough thread to screw on standoff
1x M3x8 cap head screw for attaching toolboard mount to standoff
4x M3x8 countersink head screws
2x M3x8 cap head screws (stock ones for mounting orbiter)
