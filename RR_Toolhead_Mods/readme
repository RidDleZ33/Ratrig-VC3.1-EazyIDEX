Here are notes and mods for the new RR toolhead.

Notes:
The spacer makes the revo height the same as the rapido

The RR LGx_Lite_REVO plate is experimental. The hotend will end  up 1mm forward (closer to heatbreak cooling fan) from stock plate position. This should not cause any issues? I'll update when I know for sure.


The front_beacon and toolboard_vertical parts were modified for fitment.
