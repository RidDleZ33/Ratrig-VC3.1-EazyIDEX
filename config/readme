Here are configs that I've used. The VC3.1Stock_printer.cfg is what I use for an Octopus Pro H723. The config is set to use only 1 Y driver (use the parallel Motor2 header and swap a pin in one motor connector), however you can uncomment code and use a combination of the TFT header and EXP1 to wire in an additional driver (this is what I used, you can use any open uart and pins). Good luck!
