When I went through RatOS 2.1 configurator, I simply told it I have a stock VC3.1 and configured as normal.
After this, you can use my config here as a reference to add the IDEX configs/macros. Everything is done in printer.cfg. NO need to modify any other files.

Here are configs that I've used. The stockVC3.1_printer.cfg is what I use for an Octopus Pro H723. The config is set to use only 1 Y driver (use the parallel Motor2 header and swap a pin in one motor connector), however you can uncomment code and use a combination of the TFT header and EXP1 to wire in an additional driver (this is what I used, you can use any open uart and pins). Good luck!
